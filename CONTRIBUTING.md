## How to Contribute ü§î

To get started, look at the existing [**Issues**](https://github.com/Nishitbaria/OpenGrame/issues) or [**create a new issue**](https://github.com/Nishitbaria/OpenGrame/issues/new/choose)!

### Setup guidelines ü™ú

Follow these steps to setup OpenGrame on your local machine

1. [Fork](https://github.com/Nishitbaria/OpenGrame/fork) the project
2. Clone the project to run on your local machine using the following command:

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/<your_github_username>/OpenGrame.git
   ```

3. Get into the root directory

   ```sh
   cd OpenGrame
   ```

4. Install all dependencies by running

   ```sh
   npm install
   ```

5. Create your branch

   ```sh
   git checkout -b <your_branch_name>
   ```

6. Run and view the application on localhost

   ```sh
    run dev
   ```

> **P.S**: If you have `docker` installed in your system, you can follow these steps to set up the environment:
>
> 1. After forking and cloning the repo(as mentioned above), get into the project directory:
>
> ```bash
> cd OpenGrame/
> ```
>
> 2. Start the docker container with:
>
> ```bash

> ```
>
> 3. Now start adding your changes.
>    **Note:** You don't need to restart the container again and again after starting it once, because the changes you make will reflect in the container instantly.

7. Make your changes before staging them.

8. Stage your changes

   ```sh
   git add <filename>
   ```

9. Commit your changes

   ```sh
   git commit -m "<your-commit-message>"
   ```

## Issues üéÉ

- Select an issue template from the [issues](https://github.com/Nishitbaria/OpenGrame/issues/new/choose) tab. Otherwise, choose **Other** if it doesn't match what you're looking for.
- When creating an issue, make sure you fill up all the fields properly.
- Make sure that you are NOT raising a **duplicate issue**.
- If you want to work on the issue, please click on the _I am willing to work on this issue_ checkmark.
- Add the point label that corresponds to the issue. See [our levels chart]() to help you.
- **Note:** If you aren't the owner of the issue, please comment that you're willing to work on the issue and wait for maintainers to assign you the issue. Also, don't work on the issue if you're NOT assigned.
- Please do **not** start working on the issue if you aren't yet assigned and have the `ready üöÄ` label.
- Work on only **ONE** issue at a time.

**Closing the issue** üìç

- If you decide to close the issue, please leave a brief comment describing why(e.g., I'm busy with other obligations.) before you do.
- **Note:** If the Pull Request associated with the issue gets merged and the issue still remains open, it's **your** responsibility to close the issue.

## Commits Message Guidelines üí¨

We follow a standardized commit message format using Commitlint to ensure consistency and clarity in our commit history. Each commit message should adhere to the following guidelines:

1. **Type**: The commit type must be one of the following:

   - `feat`: A new feature or enhancement.
   - `fix`: A bug fix.
   - `docs`: Documentation changes.
   - `style`: Code style changes (e.g., formatting, semicolons).
   - `refactor`: Code refactorings with no feature changes or bug fixes.
   - `test`: Adding or improving tests.
   - `chore`: General maintenance tasks, build changes, etc.

2. **Scope** (Optional): The scope provides context for the commit, indicating the specific part of the project being affected. Use a short description in lowercase (e.g., `auth`, `navbar`, `README`).

3. **Description**: A brief and meaningful description of the changes made. Start with a capital letter and use the imperative mood (e.g., "Add new feature" instead of "Added new feature").

4. **Issue reference** (Optional): Include the issue number associated with the commit (e.g., `#123`).

#### ‚úîÔ∏è Examples of Valid Commit Messages

- `feat: Add user authentication feature`
- `fix(auth): Resolve login page redirect issue`
- `docs: Update installation instructions`
- `style: Format code according to project guidelines`
- `refactor(navbar): Improve responsiveness`
- `test: Add unit tests for API endpoints`
- `chore: Update dependencies to latest versions`
- `fix: Handle edge case in data processing (#456)`

#### ‚ùå Examples of Invalid Commit Messages

- `Added new stuff`
- `Fixed a bug`
- `Updated code`
- `auth feature update`
- `chore: fixed some stuff`

### Commit Example with Commitlint

```bash
git commit -m "feat(auth): Implement user signup process (#789)"
```

## Making Pull Requests üí•

1. When you submit a pull request, several tests are automatically run
   as GitHub Actions. If any of these tests fail, it is your responsibility to try and resolve the underlying issue(s). If you don't know how to resolve the underlying issue(s), you can ask for help.

2. Each pull request should contain a single logical change or related set of changes that make sense to submit together. If a pull request becomes too large or contains too many unrelated changes, it becomes too difficult to review. In such cases, the reviewer has the right to close your pull request and ask that you submit a separate pull request for each logical set of changes that belong together.

3. Link the issue you have resolved in the Pull Request Template (e.g. Closes/Fixes #99).
4. Use our [Commit messages Guidelines](https://github.com/Nishitbaria/OpenGrame/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#commits-message-guidelines-) for your changes.
5. Do not re-open a pull request that a reviewer has closed.
   - Make sure to tick the "Allow edits from maintainers" box. This allows us to directly make minor edits / refactors and saves a lot of time.
     > **Note**
     > If your pull request has merge conflicts with the `main` branch (GitHub checks for this automatically and notifies you), you are responsible for resolving them. You can do this by merging the `main` branch into your branch (`git pull upstream main`), and then pushing the updated branch to your fork (`git push`). If you need more tips, check out [Resolving a merge conflict on GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/addressing-merge-conflicts/resolving-a-merge-conflict-on-github).
